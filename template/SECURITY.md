## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Do NOT** open a public GitHub issue
2. Email us at security@example.com with details
3. Include steps to reproduce the vulnerability
4. We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
5. We will provide updates on our investigation progress

## Security Features

### üîí Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- Multi-tenant isolation at database and API level
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Session management with automatic expiry

### üõ°Ô∏è Data Protection
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- XSS protection via Content Security Policy
- CSRF protection on all state-changing operations

### üåê Network Security
- HTTPS enforcement in production
- Security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- CORS configuration for cross-origin requests

### üìä Monitoring & Logging
- Security audit trails for authentication events
- Failed login attempt monitoring
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Automated security testing in CI/CD

## Security Configurations

### Environment Variables
Never commit sensitive environment variables. Use:
- `.env.example` for documentation
- Secret management systems in production
- Environment-specific configurations

### Content Security Policy
The application implements a strict CSP:
```
default-src 'self';
script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval';
style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com;
img-src 'self' data: https: blob:;
connect-src 'self' https: wss:;
```

### Security Headers
Production deployment includes:
- `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN`
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
- `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000`
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`

## Development Security

### Dependencies
- Automated dependency scanning with `npm audit`
- Regular updates of security patches
- License compliance checking
- Known vulnerability database monitoring

### Code Security
- Static code analysis with ESLint security rules
- TypeScript for type safety
- Input validation with Zod schemas
- Secure coding practices enforcement

### Testing
- Security-focused unit tests
- Integration tests for authentication flows
- Penetration testing guidelines
- Automated security regression tests

## Deployment Security

### Build Process
- Verification of production build integrity
- Removal of development artifacts
- Environment variable validation
- Dependency verification

### Infrastructure
- Container security scanning
- Runtime security monitoring
- Access control and audit logs
- Regular security assessments

## Security Checklist
